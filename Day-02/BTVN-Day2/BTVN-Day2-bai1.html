<h1><b>Low and Slow</b></h1>
    <p>This week 1 am <i>extremely</i> excited about cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wier bath that is aprecisele set to the turget temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking fir Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes ir as " ultra-low temperuture poaching".</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b> To reserve a seat ur the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
